toydiff
========================================

this is my diff toy :)

What it does ?
========================================

combine `diff` and `bsdiff` (for binary files) into one command,
and choose by input file

combine `patch` and `bspatch` (for binary files) into one command,
and choose by patch file

Dependency
========================================

- **Python** (I have only try this program in CPython 3.4.1)
- `sh <https://github.com/amoffat/sh/tree/master>`_
- `bsdiff <http://www.daemonology.net/bsdiff/>`_
- other simple command already exist in most Unix-like system
